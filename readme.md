# Happy Birthday Rosemary!

This project is a festive, interactive webpage dedicated to wishing Rosemary a happy birthday! The site is designed with a countdown timer, animated visual effects (floating flowers, fireworks, and moving text), and a special media section that shows either a background music widget or a YouTube video on her birthday.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer:**  
  Displays a live countdown to Rosemary’s birthday (April 7, 2025) with days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Once the birthday is reached, the timer shows a celebratory message.

- **Media Section:**  
  - **Before the Birthday:** Shows a background music widget (using an mdundo song widget) to set a festive mood.
  - **On the Birthday:** Automatically replaces the music widget with a YouTube birthday video.
  
- **Animated Visual Effects:**  
  - **Floating Flowers:** A variety of flower emojis float around the screen to add a playful touch.
  - **Fireworks:** Fireworks animations appear along the screen edges for a festive celebratory look.
  - **Moving Text:** Birthday messages with animated text add extra fun.
  
- **Birthday Cake:**  
  Features a cake graphic with candles at the bottom of the card. The candles have flickering flame animations for a realistic effect.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The site layout adjusts for smaller screens so that it looks great on mobile devices.

## File Structure

- **index.html**  
  The main HTML file that structures the webpage, including the container, card, media section, and decorations (flowers and fireworks).

- **styles.css**  
  Contains all CSS styles for layout, animations, and responsive design.

- **script.js**  
  Implements the dynamic functionality:
  - Countdown timer with live updates.
  - Switching between the mdundo music widget and the YouTube video based on the current date.
  - Creating and animating floating flowers and fireworks.
  - Auto-refresh functionality and other interactive effects.

## How to Use

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**  
   Ensure that `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` are in the same directory.

2. **Open the Website:**  
   Simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. The page will load the countdown and display the appropriate media (music or video) depending on the current date.

3. **Customization:**  
   - Update the birthday date in `script.js` if needed.
   - Customize styles in `styles.css` (colors, fonts, animations) to suit your preference.
   - Modify or add additional effects in `script.js` for further customization.

## Acknowledgments
